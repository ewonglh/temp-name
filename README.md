## Inspiration  
This project was inspired by r/BadUIBattles  
We thought it was funny and wanted to have a try  
## What it does  
Its a web experience that brings users through some intentionally ill-designed UI/UX  
It does nothing to better humanity but it is quite funny  
## How we built it  
We used React.js as a framework using Typescript and Material UI for components and tanstack for routing  
## Challenges we ran into
It was the first time all of us used the React.js framework and MUI so the learning curve was steep at first but after a while we figured out a workflow    
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making some of the worst UI/UX ever  
Such as:  
Lost Woods  
Scrambling keyboard
Collision Physics  
## What we learned
More about React.js, general website development and UI/UX components  
## What's next for Experimental 67 Factor Authentication 
Making the credentials secure (it was a 24h mockup and we do not have an external server)  
More Bad UI
